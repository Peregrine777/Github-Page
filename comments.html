        <h2> Design Ideals </h2>
            <p> The premise for the design was to make a readable, minimalistic design.
                Ideally the site would have clean styling on the elements present, without bogging down the user.
            </p>
        <h2> Text and fonts </h2>
            <p>
                The chosen font is a sans-seriff font for easier readability (as per w3) <br>

                Headings are distinguised using the color theme and a band.
                The band is achieved using a black semi-opaque layer so that the colour is not
                blinding when used in dark mode. 
                <br>
                Text colour is chosen for maximum contrast (both in light and dark mode).
            </p>
         <h2> Colour Palette </h2>   
            <p> 
                The colour palette was chosen to stick to spectrums that are discernable to
                the three most common forms of colorblindness while feeling warm and comfortable.
                The colour palette can be found online
                <a href="https://coolors.co/palette/001219-005f73-0a9396-94d2bd-e9d8a6-ee9b00-ca6702-bb3e03-ae2012-9b2226"> here</a>

                    <tr>
                        <td><img src="images/palette/palette.jpg" alt="the palette"></td>

            <h2>Accessibility</h2> 
            <p>The site was designed following <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility"> w3's accessibility principles</a>
                It uses a minimum contrast ratio of 5:1 (recommended 4.5:1 or higher) - and that is for the large title text. 
                
            </p>
            <h2>Usability</h2> 
            <div class="subheading">
                    Navbar
            </div>
            <p>
                The side-bar allows navigation from anywhere within the site, it features flexible scaling with subset scaling of elements (buttons & fonts).
                Scaling operates down to a minimum width, along with the font size, to prevent it from getting too small to read. <br>

                The bar features hover over effects with smooth transitions. It greys out the current page to aid in orienting the user.
            </p>
            <div class="subheading">
                Resizing & Inset images
            </div>
            <p>
                images auto-resize to fit the screen, all of this together allows for a smooth experience on desktop, half-width and mobile
            </p>
                <div class="insetimg">
                    <img src="images/inset/narrow.jpg" alt="narrow screenshot of webpage">
                </div>
                <div class="insetimg">
                    <img src="images/inset/wider.jpg" alt="wider screenshot of webpage">
                </div>
            <p>
                This applies to image-grids as well, 
            </p>
                <div class="insetimg">
                    <img src="images/inset/imageGrid.jpg" alt="image-grid at very narrow width">
                </div>

            
            <h2>Dark Mode</h2>
            <p>
                <span style="background-color:black;color:white">Dark mode </span> has been included via some short java code. This is a non-essential (but often appreciated) aspect of web-design.
                Dark mode replaces the background with pure black, and makes text white. 
                The header and navbar have both been made dark by default to allow consistent colour themes in dark/light mode. 
            </p>
            <h2>Known Issues</h2>
                <div class="subheading"> Dark Mode </div>
            <p> 
            
                Due to it being implented with java, which I am only just learning, dark mode implementation has issues.
                Most importantly, it does not save the setting! I have kept it in because reading/spellchecking this is a lot easier with it on.
